        How do we collect information?
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        Calida International Properties collects information in two possible ways
        </p>

        <span style="font-style: italic;">a) When you directly give it to us (&quot;Directly Provided Data&quot;)</span> <br>
When you sign up for our site, purchase our products or communicate with us,
you may choose to voluntarily give us certain information – for example, by
filling in text boxes or completing registration forms. All this information
requires a direct action by you at that time in order for us to receive it.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">
        b) When you give us permission to obtain from other accounts (&quot;User Authorised
Data&quot;)
        </span> <br>
        Depending on your settings or the privacy policies for other online services, you
may give us permission to obtain information from your account with those
other services. For example, this can be via social media or by choosing to send
us your location data when accessing our website from your smartphone or
other mobile device.

(in the case of any contact you may have with our team) for as long as is
necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        If legally required or if it is reasonably necessary to meet regulatory
requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our Terms

and Conditions, we may also retain some of your information for a limited
period of time as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no
longer needed to provide the Services to you.
